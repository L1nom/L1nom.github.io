					<h4>A Little Bit About Me</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>I am currently a fourth year software engineering student, and am currently looking for Summer
						2022 internship positions for Data Science, Data Analysis, or Machine Learning.</p>
					<p>I always thought programming was scary, however learning to program is an enjoyable process, and
						I still have more to learn, understand, and develop! </p>

					<h4>My Beginning</h4>
					<p>As many beginners, I started off learning python, since it was "easy to learn" and looked much
						begginer friendly compared to other languages.</p>
					<p>This worked out for me as I loved math, statistics, and data handling. Python has a known
						reputation for being used in Data Science and Machine Learning, which is something I aspire to
						find a career in.</p>

					<h5>Handwriting Classification</h5>
					<img src="images/handwriting.png" class="project" >
					<p>
						The first project I spent time on was to classify handwriting input from a user. When
						searching
						up beginner data science projects, this one interested me for its simplicity and complexity.
						The
						dataset was readily available, and the project steps have a nice introduction to the steps a
						data science project would incorporate.

					<h5>League of Legends Data Analysis</h5>
					<img src="images/league.jpg" class="project" >
					<p>I wanted to try analysing data on something I take see regularly, and what better way than to
						use
						data from the game I have played for 6 years? Using the RIOT Games API, once can extract
						data
						related to the account, such as wins/loss or specific scores. Along with the use Streamlit,
						I
						can display the data fetched from the given game username </p>
