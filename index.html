                    <hr>
                    <p>I am currently a fourth year software engineering student, and am currently looking for Summer 2022 internship positions for Data Science, Data Analysis, or Machine Learning.</p>
                    <p>I always thought programming was difficult, however learning to program is an enjoyable process, and I still have more to learn, understand, and develop! </p>

                    <h4>My Beginning</h4>
                    <p>As many beginners, I started off learning python, since it was "easy to learn" and looked much begginer friendly compared to other languages.
                        <br> This worked out for me as I loved math, statistics, and data handling. Python has a known reputation for being used in Data Science and Machine Learning, which is something I aspire to find a career in.</p>

                    <p>
                        The first project I spent time on was to classify handwriting input from a user. When searching up beginner data science projects, this one interested me for its simplicity and complexity. The dataset was readily available, and the project steps have
                        a nice introduction to the steps a data science project would incorporate.

                    <p>I wanted to try analysing data on something I take see regularly, and what better way than to use data from the game I have played for 6 years! Using the RIOT Games API, I was able to extract data related to an account, such as wins-loss
                        or match history logs. Along with the use Streamlit, I was able to display the data fetched from a give account, and then show related information on a web interface</p>
